        Add your CoinGecko API key (free tier available) to const apiKey = ''; in the <script> section to avoid rate limits.

APIs Used

    CoinGecko: For BTC price, market data, dominance.
    Mempool.space: For block height and hash rate.
    Alternative.me: For Fear & Greed Index.

Note: Free APIs may have rate limits. Sign up for a CoinGecko API key for better reliability.
Configuration

    Update Interval: Change setInterval(updateSats, 30000); to a higher value (e.g., 60000 for 1 minute) to reduce API calls.
    Styles: Tweak CSS in the <style> block (e.g., colors, fonts, grid columns).
    All-Time Low Persistence: Uses localStorage to track the lowest Sats per $1 seen.
